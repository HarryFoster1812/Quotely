    <p>Hello miss, I have no idea what to write in this, if you think about it, it's kinda weird I am talking to you using a website that's being hosted on the web <b>damn</b>, it's weird but it's cool. I know it's not a "<i>spectacular</i>" website and I could make it a lot better but like that's like a lot of work, who knows by the time you see this it might be a cool website (probably not). Anyway, before I begin I just want to say, don't worry miss I have my <b>shirt tucked in</b> while I'm writing this.</p>

    <h2> You know what? I'm going to explain this in bullet points</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Thank you</b></li>
      <li>You are a <i>great</i> teacher</li>
      <li>I wish you the best</li>
      <li>Have a nice life</li>
      <li>You were my favorite teacher in JESS</li>
      <li>You made maths <b>enjoyable</b></li>
      <li>I would put an anecdote here but that's like a lot of work</li>
      <li>May you continue to find success wherever you may find yourself</li>
      <li>I'm sorry for the one above</i>
      
    </ul>
    <h2>Fine, here's the <i>anecdote</i></h2>
    <p>So, all throughout primary school (Jess Jumeriah) I was always in either <i>bottom or second bottom</i> set for <b>maths</b>. I was terrible with numbers, I couldn't even do basic maths mentally. When I went to secondary (Jess Ranches) there was a requirement to take a placement test in <b>maths</b> and somehow i did well. Even to this day, I don't know how, but I ended up being placed in <i><b>top set</b></i>. I have had many thoughts on this, most in the form of questions: Do I <i>deserve</i> to be in <i><b>top set?</b></i> What will happen when they discover they made a mistake? Do I <i>belong</i> with these people in top set? Sorry, <i><b>top set?</b></i></p>

    <h2>The second <i>anecdote</i></h2>
    <p>I know right, two?! So, this one is still about <b>maths</b> and takes place in your classroom at the start of year 9. Let's begin, you know what I'm going to make this one <i>fancy</i> because I'm bored. 'Twas the first lesson of algebraic fractions, the sun was shining bright, the air was hot and Hammad and I did not have a clue what was going on. Confusion filled my head as you tried to explain in simple terms how to find x. Alas, I did not understand. I would remain in this state of puzzlement for quite some time. I have vivid memory's of staring at the white board bewildered at the lines that represented this construct, so called "<b>maths</b>." The bell cried loudly. It was the end of the lesson. I raised from my chair and began  packing away the items that I had gotten out through the course of the lesson. After, I fought my way through the sea of people to find Hammad. Once my task was successful we both stared at each other and in unison we both recited the word "nope" and then proceeded to find the exit. As we were leaving, the words "Make good choices" filled the air. Exhausted from the school-day, I entered the bus and found my place. On the journey home, my thoughts surrounding maths consumed me. The only think I could think about was the maths lesson, how do algebraic fractions work? Why are they so difficult? Why can't I understand them? Most of the class understands them why don't I?</p>

    <h2>The future...</h2>
    <p>So, I know you probably don't care but for as long as I am programming, I will be posting on my <a href="https://github.com/HarryFoster1812?tab=repositories">GitHub</a>. If you come back to this after like, a couple of years (unlikely) go check it out. See what I'm doing, how I'm doing...</p>


    <h2>One last thing...</h2>
    <p>1+1 = 2. Get it? I'm typing maths. I still don't get. In my opinion there is nothing wrong with typing maths. Why do you think  it's bad?</p>
